# Learn Verses App #

A flashcard-like app with audio playback to aid in the memorization of Bible verses.

I wrote this app as a personal project in my first baby step into mobile/app development. Hope you enjoy it!

## Features ##
* Works both in the Safari browser and in the app (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch).
* It has persistent local storage of the verses even if app is force-quit.
* Verse by verse audio to aid the auditory memory.
* Uses Phonegap framework

## Why I am proud of it ##
 While programming this project, I learned the basics of LESS CSS, Handlebars.js, Jquery Mobile, XML, and Local Storage. 
 
### Challenges of Development ###
* Having to interact with an API not formulated for javascript.
* Creating a partial function for reading local files for Handlebars.js and initializing callback javascript.
* Refactoring and optimizing my code again and again.

But in the end, I had a working app that could be published!
